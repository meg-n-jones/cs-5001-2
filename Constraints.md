## Constraints

### Time
One of the major factors I feel may impact our group is time going into our senior design project. In our case, time is the duration of hours in our schedules
we can deticate to our senior project. This year, on top of senior lectures and homework, we have two members of our team involved in the UC Bearcat Marching Band.
This activity alone takes up approximately 7 hours for rehearsals per week, and an additional 9 hrs on weekends when football games or events pop up for the marching band
to go to. This doesn't include the time spent outside rehearsals practicing or travel to and from games/practice. On top of homework, studying, and other obligations,
there isn't much time left this semester to spend working through our senior project. 

### Ethical
The standpoint of our project may impact members of the community who have had involvement in military or other weapon-involved jobs, such as the police force. One way 
we aim to combat this in our 2D combat simulator is to make our simulation based on figures with fewer polygons, and possibly making the simulator have an eagle eye POV or
3rd person point of view to make it less real. We will also offer ways for the user to control the environment variables to their tastes, and work to make targets in the 
simulator less human-like. In these ways, we aim to make the combat simulator have a neutral impact on those communities who use firearms for their jobs.

### Techinal Expertise
Our project, with building a simulator, requires more technical expertise in building a game engine, creating a GUI, and modules designed for game development. Our group
collectively doesn't have much experience with developing simulators. On top of that, we don't have experience in Unity and I at least have very little experience building
programs in Python. So, with the lack of technical experience in this area, the learning curve for this project is going to be relatively steep and take more time to 
learn how to build things instead of actually building each piece of the simulator.
