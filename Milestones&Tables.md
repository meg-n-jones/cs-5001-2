## **Milestones**

1. Deciding on a project timeline and research

    Our first major milestone in our senior design project is developing a timeline and researching methods to building this 2D simulator. This also includes finding a suitable advisor to our project, and developing a layout for how we will divide the work and time throughout the semester

2. Building the Simulator

    This major milestone will be the benchmark for progress throughout the rest of our senior design project. For this, the engine for the simulation will be complete, along with 

3. Adding Autonomous Control Strategies
    
    We now have the engine built, but no controls for what the game engine should do, or shouldn't do. In this, we are defining the behavior of the program and adding strategies for implementation in the environment.
    
4. Adding GUI and Controls
 
    For this step, we aim to provide the end-user with a graphical interface to interact with the environment created by the game engine and the constraints from the control strategies. In this, we also aim to link those controls to an Xbox or Playstation controller for ease of use and practicality.   
 
5. Final Touch Ups

    This final step is to add any last minute refinements or perform any testing for our simulator.
