Over the course of the autumn semester, I spent time working through building out the [PowerPoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rwM0utYZtp_vqbfTYE0dG_m_hfeOB4y3qRT83yqPRhY/edit?usp=sharing) for the prototype of our
project, developing a [prototype test plan](https://github.com/meg-n-jones/cs-5001-2/blob/main/Milestones%26Tables.md), and building out the repo for our prototype project. During
the spring semester, I spent time dedicated to building out 2 different levels and 4 abilties in 2Design It (our current project), developing the [website](https://jones8mn.wixsite.com/2designit)
