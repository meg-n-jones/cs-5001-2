### *More Specific Details*


Access into **2Design It** begins from its start menu, shown below

To access a particluar level, you would need to click on it with your mouse. Only the levels in the white boxes are accessible to
the player, and they are updated with each level you complete. The Exit Game button exits the game completely, and there are 
also secret beta tester buttons located in the triangle between Levels 1, 2, and 5, and in the triangle between Levels 3, 4, 
and 6 to unlock and re-lock levels repsectively. 


Upon entering a level, the player would see something similar to this:

From this point, the player is able to only move left and right using the arrow keys or the 'A' and 'D' keys. As you progress
through each level, you are able to unlock more abilities that are locked behind coding questions. The list of unlockable abilities
are as follows:


* Level 1: Moving Left and Right - *Using <- and ->, or A and D*
* Level 2: Dashing and Jumping - *Dash: Shift + <- or >, Jump: Spacebar*
* Level 3: Moving Objects and Destroying Obstacles - *Moving Obj: E + <- or ->, Destorying Obj: Jump on correct answer button*
* Level 4: Multijump - *Multijump: Spacebar x2*
* Level 5: Swimming and Cutting Grass - *Swim: Spacebar multiple times to swim up, Cut Grass: E next to cuttable grass*


Level 6 is a demonstration of all the abilities unlocked through the game, so there are no unlockables there. 


Below is a screenshot of the pause menu, accessible through hitting the ESC key:

Resume continues you through the level, Restart resets the level from the very beginning (or in the case of Levels 2 and 5, it
resests you to your latest checkpoint), and Exit returns you to the main screen.
