**Project 17: Real-Time 2D Differential Game Combat Simulation**


**Advisor: Prof Zach Fuchs, fuchze@ucmail.uc.edu**


  As part of the Air Force Research Lab funed research, Dr. Fuchs' research group has developed several autonomous control strategies for
  multi-agent scenarios such as dog-fighting, high-value target defense, surveillance, and pursuit-evasion. The proposed senior design project
  is to develop a simple two-dimensional simulation environment in Python in order to test these controllers in real time. Although the 
  controllers have been previously developed and tested in simulation against scripted behaviors, the propsed project will be run in real 
  time and will allow humans to control a subset of the agents via Xbox Controller. Dr. Fuchs and the student will work to identify which 
  of the previously investigated control scenarios to implement within the simulation environment.


  The project will have three primary tasks. 1) Develop a simple two-dimensional simulation engine in Python (or Unity if preferred). There
  are several existing libraries that make this a relatively straightforward process. 2) INtegrate previously developed autonomous control 
  strategies into the simulation. Most of these control strategies have been previously implemented or developed in MatLab. The student
  will either need to develop a wrapper to call the MatLab files, or reimplement the controllers in Python. The controllers are relatively
  simple so reimplementing them should be relatively easy. 3) Devlop a graphical user interface (GUI) that will allow a human user to define 
  scenario parameters and select which agents to control within the scenario. Once the parameters are selected, the simulator initializes
  the scenario and allows the user to control the agents via an xbox game controller.
