## Project Abstract
In our society, video games have long been a source of joy, frustration, and a great way to pass time. Depending on the game, users can be brought into a riveting story or work progressively through levels to achieve completion of the game. We aim to add more educational benefits to the world of gaming, by allowing users to manipulate the environment in a 2D combative simulator. By altering the physics and environment in a simulator, we can investigate how varied scenarios become with the change of a single variable. Thus, we determine exactly which variables could sway a combative experience in favor of the winning side.
